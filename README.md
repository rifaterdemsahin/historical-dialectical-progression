# Historical Dialectical Progression

> https://rifaterdemsahin.github.io/historical-dialectical-progression/

## Overview

An interactive visualization of Marxist Historical Materialism, demonstrating the dialectical progression of human societies through five distinct historical stages. This project explores the evolution of economic systems, class conflicts, and the transformation of property relations throughout history.

## Features

### 🎨 Interactive Visualization
- **Five Historical Stages**: From Primitive Communism to the emerging AI Era
- **Clickable Stages**: Explore detailed information about each historical period
- **Hover Effects**: Dynamic highlighting of related concepts and stages
- **Modal Views**: In-depth analysis of means of production, labor divisions, and property relations

### 📊 Key Concepts
- **Division of Labor**: Evolution from simple communal work to algorithmic automation
- **Property Relations**: Transformation from communal ownership to data/platform capitalism
- **Class Conflict**: The driving force behind historical transitions
- **Dialectical Process**: Thesis, antithesis, and synthesis throughout history

### 📱 Responsive Design
- Fully responsive layout optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop devices
- Adaptive typography and spacing for all screen sizes

## Educational Context

This visualization is based on Karl Marx's theory of historical materialism, which posits that the material conditions of a society's mode of production fundamentally determine its organization and development. Each stage represents a distinct mode of production characterized by:

- **Means of Production**: The tools and systems used to produce goods
- **Relations of Production**: The social relationships people enter into as they produce
- **Class Conflict**: The contradiction between classes that drives historical change
